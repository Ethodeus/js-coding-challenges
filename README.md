# My daily coding challenges

This space is dedicated for my currently codewars progression, I like to keep track of every challenge that I overcome and I will do my best to go back, review my code and refactor with new and more efficient things that i've learned.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** Mainly JavaScript for now, will be adding frameworks along the way. 

## Optimizations

I'm constantly reviewing my codewars to see if there is a better way to approach every problem to make it more readable, efficient, or even shorter.

This is a great motivation to keep learning and not feel discouraged, because even though you feel like you're not making progress or learning much, you are.
