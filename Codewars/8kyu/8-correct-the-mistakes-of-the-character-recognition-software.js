//* NAME -> Correct the mistakes of the character recognition software

//TODO INSTRUCTIONS ->

/*
Character recognition software is widely used to digitise printed texts. Thus the texts can be edited, searched and stored on a computer.

When documents (especially pretty old ones written with a typewriter), are digitised character recognition softwares often make mistakes.

Your task is correct the errors in the digitised text. You only have to handle the following mistakes:

S is misinterpreted as 5
O is misinterpreted as 0
I is misinterpreted as 1

The test cases contain numbers only by mistake.
*/

//SOLUTION(S) ->

function correct(string) {
	for (let i = 0; i < string.length; i++) {
		if (string[i] === '0') {
			string = string.replace('0', 'O');
		}
		if (string[i] === '5') {
			string = string.replace('5', 'S');
		}
		if (string[i] === '1') {
			string = string.replace('1', 'I');
		}
	}

	return string;
}

//TEST CASES ->
